## Usage

To install this repository, simply clone it and open the index.html file. Your browser will need to have javascript enabled.

`git clone https://github.com/GrahamJerome/memory_game.git`

## Instructions

To play the game, simply click on a square, and then a subsequent square to see if it is a match. If it is a match it will stay visible. If it is not a match the squares will reset. Each time a comparison is made the moves counter will increase by one. Starting at 20 moves, and every 10 thereafter, the star ranking will decrease by one, to a maximum of three.

Once the first tile is clicked a timer will start to indicate the total time it took to complete one game. If the game is reset, so is the timer, moves, and star value.

To manually reset without winning click the reset button in the top right.
